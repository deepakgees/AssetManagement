# Duplicate Checking Functionality Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
You requested to update the duplicate checking functionality so that while uploading a file, the system first displays a prompt showing how many duplicate records were found and asks whether you would like to add those duplicate records or not.

## What Was Implemented

### ‚úÖ **New Duplicate Checking Flow**

1. **Pre-Upload Duplicate Detection**
   - When you select a file and click "Upload", the system first parses the file and checks for duplicates
   - Shows "Checking Duplicates..." status during this process
   - Compares file records against existing database records for the selected account

2. **Duplicate Confirmation Modal**
   - If duplicates are found, a new modal appears showing:
     - Total records in the file
     - Number of duplicate records found
     - Number of unique records that will be added
     - Preview of duplicate records (first 10 with pagination)
   - Three action buttons:
     - **Cancel**: Abort the upload
     - **Upload Unique Records**: Skip duplicates and only add new records
     - **Upload All Records**: Include duplicates (they will be handled by database constraints)

3. **Smart Upload Options**
   - **Skip Duplicates**: Filters out duplicates before database insertion (faster, cleaner)
   - **Include Duplicates**: Attempts to insert all records (duplicates will be skipped by database constraints)

### üîß **Technical Implementation**

#### Backend Changes:
1. **New Endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/pnl/parse-and-check-duplicates/:accountId`
   - `POST /api/dividends/parse-and-check-duplicates/:accountId`
   - These parse CSV files without saving to database and return duplicate analysis

2. **Enhanced Upload Endpoints**:
   - Added `skipDuplicates` parameter to control duplicate handling
   - Optimized duplicate filtering for better performance

3. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Graceful fallback if duplicate checking fails
   - Detailed logging for troubleshooting

#### Frontend Changes:
1. **New State Management**:
   - Added `showDuplicateModal` state for duplicate confirmation
   - Added `checkingDuplicates` state for loading indicator
   - Added `duplicateInfo` state to store duplicate analysis results

2. **Enhanced Upload Flow**:
   - File selection ‚Üí Duplicate check ‚Üí Confirmation modal ‚Üí Upload
   - Clear visual feedback during each step

3. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Detailed duplicate information display
   - Preview table of duplicate records
   - Clear action buttons with descriptive labels

### üìä **Duplicate Detection Logic**

#### P&L Records:
Records are considered duplicates if ALL these fields match:
- Symbol, Instrument Type, Entry Date, Exit Date, Quantity, Buy Value, Sell Value, Profit

#### Dividend Records:
Records are considered duplicates if ALL these fields match:
- Symbol, ISIN, Ex-Date, Quantity, Dividend Per Share, Net Dividend Amount

### üéØ **User Experience**

#### Before Upload:
1. Select CSV file
2. Click "Upload"
3. System shows "Checking Duplicates..."
4. If duplicates found ‚Üí Confirmation modal appears
5. Choose action:
   - **Cancel**: Abort upload
   - **Upload Unique**: Add only new records
   - **Upload All**: Add all records (duplicates will be skipped)

#### No Duplicates:
- File uploads directly without confirmation modal
- Normal upload process continues

### üîÑ **Upload Options Explained**

#### "Upload Unique Records" (Green Button):
- **What it does**: Filters out duplicates before database insertion
- **Performance**: Faster upload (batch insertion of unique records only)
- **Result**: Only new, unique records are added to database
- **Use case**: When you want to avoid any duplicate processing

#### "Upload All Records" (Yellow Button):
- **What it does**: Attempts to insert all records including duplicates
- **Performance**: Slower (individual record insertion with duplicate detection)
- **Result**: Duplicates are skipped by database constraints, unique records are added
- **Use case**: When you want the system to handle duplicates automatically

### üìÅ **Files Modified**

#### Backend:
- `backend/src/routes/pnl.ts` - Added duplicate checking endpoints and enhanced upload logic
- `backend/src/routes/dividends.ts` - Added duplicate checking endpoints and enhanced upload logic

#### Frontend:
- `frontend/src/pages/PnL.tsx` - Added duplicate confirmation modal and enhanced upload flow
- `frontend/src/services/pnlService.ts` - Added duplicate checking method
- `frontend/src/services/dividendService.ts` - Added duplicate checking method

### üöÄ **Benefits**

1. **Transparency**: You know exactly what will be uploaded before it happens
2. **Control**: You can choose how to handle duplicates
3. **Efficiency**: Skip duplicates option provides faster uploads
4. **Safety**: No accidental duplicate uploads
5. **User-Friendly**: Clear visual feedback and intuitive interface

### üîß **How to Use**

1. **Navigate to P&L page**
2. **Select an account** (if not already selected)
3. **Click "Upload CSV"** button
4. **Select your CSV file**
5. **Click "Upload"**
6. **If duplicates found**:
   - Review the duplicate information
   - Choose your preferred action
   - Click the appropriate button
7. **If no duplicates**: File uploads automatically

### üìù **Notes**

- The system automatically detects whether the file is P&L or Dividend based on content
- Duplicate checking is performed against existing records for the selected account only
- The preview table shows up to 10 duplicate records with pagination indicator
- All duplicate prevention mechanisms from the previous implementation remain active
- The system gracefully handles errors and falls back to normal upload if duplicate checking fails

The duplicate checking functionality is now fully implemented and provides you with complete control over how duplicates are handled during file uploads.
